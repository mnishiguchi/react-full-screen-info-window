# React full-screen morph button

In this repo, I demonstrate a react component that expands to the full screen
when clicked. The ideas are heavily adopted from [ButtonComponentMorph](https://github.com/codrops/ButtonComponentMorph/)
with a companion article
[Morphing Buttons Concept](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/05/12/morphing-buttons-concept/)
by Codrops.

## Things I learned

- [Prevent body scrolling but allow overlay scrolling](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9280412/3837223)
